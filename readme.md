For running the script: to get your token, go to fishtank.live and find something like https://securetoken.googleapis.com/v1/token?key=KEYHERE in the Network panel in developer tools. Go to it and get refresh_token, put it in get_stream_urls.py then run it, it'll spit out all the stream links if it's valid.
